# js-cypress-step
JavaScript Cypress automation tests created to test authorisation
and appearance of the tabs in the "step" application.
#### What is the "step" application?
"step" is a unified platform for software automation that allows you to make
the most out of automation artifacts while getting rid of specific tools.
More information you can get here: https://step.exense.ch/knowledgebase/3.18/

### "step" installation
First, you need to install the actual Java Development Kit (18 or above) from here:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java18. Be aware about the environmental
variables!![img_3.png](img_3.png)
Also, add the java home path to the Path variable.

Second, you need to install the Community MongoDB Server from here:
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Download the `agent` and the `controller` from here:
https://github.com/exense/step/releases/latest

Unzip both step archives. There should be a controller folder and an agent folder.
Run through the default steps of MongoDBâ€™s installation wizard, using the default port.
Choose to install the MongoDB Compass from the installation wizard mentioned before.

### Start the "step"
Open the MongoDB Compass and click green `Connect` button. If you have an error in
process, tap the `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`, go to the `Services` tab, find the MongoDB process,
click `Right Mouse Button` on it and click `Run`:![img_4.png](img_4.png)

Then, go to the step controller folder, `bin/startController.bat` and run it.
Optionally, you can run the step agent from `'step-agent-folder'/bin/startAgent.bat`.
After that go to the `localhost:8080`. If everything is okay, you will see this page:
![img_5.png](img_5.png)
If you see anything else, that means you need to terminate controller and agent,
open the command prompt in administrator mode and use the `netstat -ano | findstr :8080`.
Then the pid will appear at the right which you can kill with taskkill.
![img_6.png](img_6.png)
Use the `taskkill /pid 11704 /F` command and start controller and agent again.

Note: login: admin and password: init are default values.

### Project installation
You need to install a Node.js LTS:![img_1.png](img_1.png)
Using this reference: https://nodejs.org/en/

Then, you can download the project.![img_2.png](img_2.png)
Click the "code" button. You can download ZIP archive or use the `git clone`
command.

After that open the command prompt in the project folder and run the
`npm install`, and then execute the `npm i cypress typescript --save-dev` command.

### How to start your tests
To run the tests you can use the `npx cypress run` command or if you want to open
the Cypress UI you can use the `npx cypress open` command. Please, be sure that
your npx is installed. It can be pre-installed with npm > v.5.2 or installed separately.
